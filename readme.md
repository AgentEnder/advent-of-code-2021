# Polyglot AoC 2021

This is my repo for Advent of Code 2021 problems. The repo is setup for solving the problems in C#, Python, Rust, and Typescript currently.

## Running Solutions

1. Run `npm i` 
2. Run `npm start`

This assumes the following commands are available on PATH
- `python3 --version`
- `dotnet --version`
- `rustc --version`
- `node`
- `npx`
- `kotlinc -help`
